Submitted by: **Jennifer Neto**

Time spent: **2h:30m** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I only used the prework instruction sheet]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I faced a challenge when I implemented the game’s sound and visuals to start playing when the user pressed the "start" button. At first, I followed all of the instructions
and thought it would work accordingly. Unfortunately, during my testing, I realized the game was not generating light or sound on the buttons when pressed.
I tried analyzing and debugging my code to make sure everything was correct and looked over the instructions sheet to make sure I hadn't missed anything, such as a function or class.
Everything looked correct, but the game was still not working correctly. I decided to check the console using my developer view in the browser. And quickly found the issue. 
I noticed an error was displayed in the developer view of the line with the console.log() for the playClueSequence() part of the function. I decided to comment it out and see if it would work.
After I commented out the line, the game started to work correctly; however, that reasoning was incorrect. After looking over the code one more time, I noticed the misspelled syntax, fixed the syntax from “console.long” to “console.log,” and the game began to work. 
Fortunately, the game started to work correctly after I fixed the misspelling.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[ Web development can be tricky, and there are many different methods that you can use to achieve the result you want. With this project, I noticed that JavaScript libraries were used to generate the audio when the button was pressed. 
I am very interested in knowing more about how these libraries are developed and to learn more about other JavaScript libraries. I know that libraries can have specific functions, methods, and objects that can then be called upon when needed. 
If I am aware of the other free libraries available to me during web development, I feel that the possibilities would be endless for what I can create on an HTML page.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I began working on this project during my midterms. My school had sent me the information about this fantastic opportunity a couple of weeks before the application process closed.
I rushed my development because I wanted to have at least the basic requirements working to be considered for the summer internship. If I had more time to work on the project,
I would add all of the optional features and do my research to personalize the game and add my unique touch such as additional sounds, a scoreboard and multiplayer so that two players can play the game simultaneously. 
I know that I would be able to add these special features, given that I had to teach myself how to use C# for one of my classes last semester to create a personalized videogame. 
I learned the language and used Unity for the first time to create three different games and passed the class with an A.
This project was enjoyable to work on, but unfortunately, I could not give it my all since excelling in school is my priority.
